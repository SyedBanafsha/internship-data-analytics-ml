## Streamlit Applications

This folder contains Streamlit-based web applications developed during the internship.

The applications demonstrate:
- Streamlit basics (UI components, layout, interaction)
- Integration of machine learning models with a frontend interface
- Real-time prediction using trained ML models

These applications were developed using Python and Streamlit as part of hands-on learning and deployment practice.
