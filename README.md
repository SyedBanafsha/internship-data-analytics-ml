## Internship Projects – Data Analytics & Machine Learning

This repository contains the work completed during my internship in Data Analytics and Machine Learning, with a focus on practical implementation and deployment using Python.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## Projects Included

### Ice Cream Sales Prediction
- Regression-based machine learning model to predict daily ice cream sales using temperature data.
- Model training, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit for real-time predictions.

### Diabetes Prediction
- Binary classification model using Logistic Regression.
- Applied data preprocessing and model evaluation techniques.

### NLP Text Analysis
- Text preprocessing, vectorization, and model training for text-based analysis.

## Streamlit Applications
- Streamlit basics for UI components.
- Advanced Streamlit application with ML model integration and prediction.

## Outcome
This repository demonstrates hands-on experience in building end-to-end machine learning projects, from data analysis to deployment.
